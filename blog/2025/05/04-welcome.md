Hello, world! 👋

<!-- TODO: Adicionar link para o about me depois -->

I’m **[Marco Antônio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tchez)** and this is my **Brain Blog**.

This first post is a quick tour of what you’ll find here.

### Why “Brain Blog”?

> _“Those who teach learn while teaching, and those who learn teach while learning.”_
> — Paulo Freire (Translated from Portuguese)

Brain Blog is a public backup of my brain where I capture study notes,
organize references and document learning journeys.

### Content structure

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs defaultValue="blog">
  <TabItem value="blog" label="Blog">
    <br/>
    > My personal stream of ideas and experience.
    
    You’ll read articles, tutorials and reflections on topics that excite me,
    plus lessons learned from real‑world projects.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="notes" label="Notes">
    <br/>
    > A structured knowledge vault.

    Here you’ll find study notes, summaries and references on topics I’m exploring. The goal is to create a knowledge repository that’s useful for me and others.

    For now, this section includes just my projects:

    - **[Projects](/notes/projects/intro)** – write‑ups and documentation of things I’m building or ideas I’m exploring.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

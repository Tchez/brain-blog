Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Marco AntÃ´nio**, the maintainer of this blog.

This post is a quick introduction to what you can expect from this space.

This space is my public second brain, split in two parts:

| Section   | What youâ€™ll find                                      |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blog**  | Opinions, tutorials, life lessons                     |
| **Notes** | Structured knowledge â€” jorneys, foundations, projects |

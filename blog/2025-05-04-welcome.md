Hello, world! 👋  
I’m **[Marco Antônio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tchez)** and this is my **Brain Blog**.  
This first post is a quick tour of what you’ll find here.

### Why “Brain Blog”?

> _“When we teach, we learn twice.”_  
> — Translated from Paulo Freire

Brain Blog is a public backup of my brain where I capture study notes,
organise references and document learning journeys.

### Content structure

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs defaultValue="blog">
  <TabItem value="blog" label="Blog">
    <br/>
    > My personal stream of ideas and experience.
    
    You’ll read articles, tutorials and reflections on topics that excite me,
    plus lessons learned from real‑world projects.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="notes" label="Notes">
    <br/>
    > A structured knowledge vault.
    
    I publish notes, summaries and references from everything I study,
    turning them into a reusable base.
    
    Notes are split into three sections:
    
    - **[Foundations](/notes/foundations/intro)** – core explanations of fundamentals (math, algorithms, protocols…).
    - **[Projects](/notes/projects/intro)** – write‑ups of things I’m building or ideas I’m exploring.
    - **[Jorneys](/notes/jorneys/intro)** – step‑by‑step road‑maps of mastering a specific topic, linking to resources and notes.
  </TabItem>

# About Brain Blog

**Brain Blog** is my second brain. A public repository/blog where I record, structure, and share my learning over time.

It serves to:

- Better fix the concepts I study;
- Share knowledge with others;
- Create a reusable base for future queries;
- Create a learning portfolio.

## 🌍 Bilingua

All content is written in English (main language) and translated into Portuguese.

## 📚 Fundamentals

The fundamentals learned in the sagas are organized in a dedicated section, as many concepts are interconnected and can be applied in different contexts.

## 📚 Learning Sagas

I will structure some content in **sagas**: a journey to learn a specific topic.
The first saga is about **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning**. I will start with the book _Why Machines Learn?_

# About Brain Blog

**Brain Blog** is my second brain. A public repository/blog where I record, structure, and share my learning over time.

It is organized into three main sections:

- **Foundations**: reusable concepts like math, algorithms, communication protocols.
- **Journeys**: deep learning paths focused on a topic (e.g., AI).
- **Tutorials**: practical tutorials and standalone guides.

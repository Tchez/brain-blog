SpeakUp Palmas holds monthly in-person meetings, and to ensure everything goes smoothly, it's important to follow a schedule of recurring tasks.

## Weekly breakdown

To make organization easier, weâ€™ve divided activities into four weeks, each with a specific focus. The goal is to ensure all aspects of the event are covered, from setting the date to collecting post-event feedback.

_SpeakUp Palmas_ holds **monthly in-person meetings**.  
To ensure everything goes smoothly, it's important to follow a schedule of recurring tasks.

## Weekly Breakdown

<div className="alert alert--info" role="alert">Each task has one or more people responsible, indicated by colored buttons next to the task title. The buttons represent areas of responsibility, such as Marketing, Logistics, Activities, etc.</div>

<br/>

To streamline organization, we divide tasks into four weeks, each with a specific focus. The goal is to make sure all aspects of the event are covered, from defining the date to collecting post-event feedback.

<br/>

|  Week | Focus                    | Summary of Activities                                                 |
| ----: | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Planning & Organization  | Define and validate the date and location · Engage the community      |
| **2** | Confirmation & Marketing | Announce location and time · Finalize activities and logistics        |
| **3** | Event Week               | Countdown posts · On-site logistics and engagement during the event   |
| **4** | Post-event & Feedback    | Organize drive folders · Share photos · Analyze feedback and insights |

> Below you’ll find a breakdown of each week with specific tasks to be performed.

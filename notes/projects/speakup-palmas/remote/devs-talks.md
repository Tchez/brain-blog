A space for monthly or biweekly meetups focused exclusively on helping the tech community practice English with a technical focus.

### Suggested Formats

- **Tech Demo** — Practical demonstration of something built by the dev, with explanations in English.
- **Code Review in English** — Code reading and discussion with comments made in English.
- **Thematic Panel** — Open discussions around a specific topic in the tech field.

### Goals

# Projects

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to document my projects and future ideas, whether related to technology or not. I want to record the details of the projects, document how they work, share learnings and reflections, and also maintain a portfolio of my work.

## How it is organized

- **[Ongoing projects](#ongoing)** ongoing projects with documentation and regular updates
- **[Completed projects](#completed)** completed projects with retrospectives and lessons learned
- **[Ideas](#ideas)** space for suggestions, sketches, and proofs of concept

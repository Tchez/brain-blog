SpeakUp hosts remote meetups on Discord, and to ensure everything runs smoothly, it's important to follow a schedule of recurring tasks focused on community organization and technical support.

## Weekly Breakdown

We organize the tasks into four weeks, each with a specific focus, to ensure the event is well planned, promoted, executed, and evaluated.

<br/>

|  **2** | Confirmation & Promotion | Confirm host and script · Promote on social media and groups                            |

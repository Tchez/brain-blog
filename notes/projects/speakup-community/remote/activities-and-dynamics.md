- **Extra sessions — no fixed cadence.** They may be organized by **Admins** or by **Clubs**.
  - If **club-internal**, no validation needed.
  - If proposed as an **extra official event**, it goes through **validation** and receives **organization and promotion support** from the team.

## Remote Edition — monthly (official)

### General guidelines

- **Platform:** **Discord** voice channels.
- **Duration:** **no hard end time** — we officially wrap up the activities, then keep the room open for free practice.

:::tip
Welcoming first: assess the group’s level, slow down when needed, and encourage those who are just starting.
:::

### Base flow

1. **Welcome & introductions (in English)** + **group icebreaker** (e.g., _Guess the Word_).
2. **Split into activities:**
   - **Games:** a voice channel with a game (e.g., **Gartic Phone** or other light practice).
   - **Free conversation:** a voice channel for an open, unstructured chat.
   - **Many participants?** The **supervisor** creates **additional rooms** as needed.
3. **Official wrap-up** of activities + invitation to **free practice**.
4. **Feedback** via form.

## Games & dynamics

- For online games, **prioritize free options** that run in the browser/Discord.
- The **final choice** of games is made by the **Admins** for each meet-up.

---

## Clubs (focused groups)

**Clubs** are self-organized thematic groups (e.g., **Book**, **Anime**, **Law**, **AI**). They may use text/voice channels **any time** for general or topic-focused practice.

### Structure & roles

- Each club should have a **President**, **Vice**, and **Admins**.
- Responsibilities: organize sessions, ensure a welcoming environment, and agree on simple club rules.

### How to create a club

1. Contact an **Admin** to fill out the **club creation form**.
2. Wait for **Admin approval**.
3. Once approved, the club receives a **dedicated channel section** on Discord.

### Types of club sessions

- **Club-internal:** open and informal, no validation needed.
- **Extra official:** when it makes sense, the club can propose an extra official event; if **validated**, Admins **help organize and promote** it.

---

## Ombudsman & moderation

- Use the **ombudsman channel** (or DM the moderators) to report discomfort.
- If the group levels feel very different, **ask to switch rooms** — adjusting is totally fine!
- Reminder to all: **safe, welcoming, and judgment-free environment**.

## Devs Talks (official club)

The first official club on the server, focused on helping the tech community practice English with technical content.

### Suggested formats

- **Lightning Talk:** **30–60 min** mini-talks (architecture, frameworks, experiences, tools).
- **Tech Demo:** a hands-on demo with explanations in English.
- **Code Review in English:** reading and discussing code.
- **Thematic Panel:** open discussion on a specific technical topic.

### Goals

- Practice **technical vocabulary** in English.
- Develop **public speaking**.
- Build a **support network** among devs improving their English.
- Encourage **real-world experience sharing** from day-to-day work.

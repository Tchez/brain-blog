## Mission

Our mission is to promote English practice in a relaxed, welcoming, and collaborative environment. We want to help people feel more confident speaking English, regardless of their fluency level.

## Objectives

- Provide a friendly, welcoming, and collaborative space for English practice.
- Connect people with similar interests and encourage the exchange of experiences.
- Offer dynamic and informal meetups that make it easy to practice English at any level.

## How does it work?

- **In-person meetups:** Held once a month in Palmas-TO, at venues chosen through a WhatsApp group poll.
- **Remote meetups:** Via Discord, featuring games, activities, and free conversation.
- **Active community:** We have a WhatsApp group where participants can interact, share tips, and exchange information about learning English. We now also have a Discord server to streamline communication and host online events.

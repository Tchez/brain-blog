# Foundations

## What they are

Core topics — math, algorithms, protocols — that resurface across multiple journeys and projects. Each note explains **why it matters**, **how it works**, and when to use the concept.

## Why document

- Consolidate understanding (learn by teaching)
- Provide a quick reference guide
- Avoid repeating explanations inside Journeys

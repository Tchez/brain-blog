# Journeys

## What they are

Study diaries focused on a **macro-topic** (AI, Security, DevOps …). Each journey follows a path of books, papers, courses and practical projects.

## Objectives

1. Record the path taken
   - What I learned
   - What I’ll skip (for now)
   - What I plan to deepen later
2. Share useful references
3. Simplify future review

## Active journeys

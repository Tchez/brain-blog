# Learning AI

<!-- > **Status:** in progress (last update: 15 May 2025) -->

<br/>
Welcome to my ongoing **Artificial Intelligence** journey!  
Here you can track **what** I study, **why** I study it, and **how** I put it into practice.

<!-- ## Journey structure

- **Road-map:** high-level stages with progress links (`roadmap.md`)
- **References:** books, courses and papers in dedicated sub-folders
- **Practical projects:** real-world builds under `projects/`

## Main stages

| Stage                    | Key content                            | Status         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Mathematical foundations | Linear algebra, statistics, calculus   | 🔄 In progress |
| Supervised learning      | Regression, classification, SVM, trees | ⏳ Next        |
| Unsupervised learning    | Clustering, dimensionality reduction   | ⏳ Next        |
| Deep learning            | Neural nets, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers  | ⏳ Next        |
